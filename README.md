## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Relative positioning

### Continued development

I've got to get more comfortable with positioning (absolute and relative), and negative margins. I also have to get more comfortable with using images as objects, svgs, and background images. I struggled with envisioning how to get things in the places they needed to go because I've avoided having to deal with this kind of issue in the past.
